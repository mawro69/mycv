### My favorite quote :
“LAW 46
Never Appear Too Perfect

Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to occasionally display defects, and admit to harmless vices, in order to deflect envy and appear more human and approachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect with impunity.”

### Who I'm : 

#### In two verse 

My name is Anwar and this world, I'm out of it 

'Cause with all this $\alpha - \beta -\gamma$ shit, I'm startin' to sound like A Math-ALF a bit

Ha ha, It kill me, this technologie and climate change's counterfeit

I was mislead by the sound of it, how am I gonna get turnt up on this coffee shit? (Yeah)


Checked in parameters of markov chain hidden 

Ciga coffe, then chill and try to find my problems

Living a quarter century caused me to feel like I'm going bonkers

For real, think my neural network just born and grown and now start talkin'

I spilled like, 5 years increasin' my it, math and data skills

Think my neural networks is startin' to feel like a spoiled carton of milk

### PHD Subject 

[Title : Statistical learning for OTU identification and biodiversity characterization ](/pdf/nvtemp.pdf)
<img src="images/premierpage.png?raw=true"/>
## Résumé
The study of biology combines studies of forms (diversity) and process modelling (functional or evolutionary). Pleiade responds to the dual challenge of rapidly and appropriately measuring dissimilarities between biological objects and exploring the relationships between the diversity of features and the diversity of functions at multiple scales. We develop algorithms, models, and software frameworks for applications in ecology, evolution and biotechnology. This is a thesis offer in the context of a collaboration between INRA and INRA, combining skills in ecology, statistical modelling and intensive computing. It is a question of building OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) with metabarcoding tools (and making them evolve) from data sets of protist communities from NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) with for the thesis a scale up challenge for statistical methods given the size of the data sets. The expected work is therefore multidisciplinary in nature, with a basic disciplinary competence in statistical modelling and intensive computing. The candidate must show an openness towards the finalised aspects of these disciplines, in particular in digital ecology and taxonomy. The candidate will be supervised by three teams: statistical modelling (INRA MIAT unit in Toulouse, Nathalie Peyrard), metabarcoding and data analysis (Pleiade team, INRIA SO & INRA BioGeCo, Alain Franc), and High Throughput Data Analysis (Hiepacs team, INRIA SO, Olivier Coulaud). The ability to work in a multidisciplinary context is both an asset of this position and a required skill.

Abstract


OTU identification by clustering and by model S.B.M.
 This internship, has several aims, here is a short presentation :
• First of all, I need to use the SBM framework and the VEM algorithm conventionally used for
estimating the model.
• Next, I’ll set up a complete processing pipeline from the Sequence Alignment Distance Matrix
to identifying groups and their links.
• Then the pipeline will be implemented on biodiversity data of the Guyanese forest for data of
which we have all the taxonomic information (order, species, genera, families).
• Finally, I will be interested in comparing the classification via SBM and another unsupervised
learning method which is the hierarchical classification. For this, we will take the same set
of data, on Guyanese trees on which, we will make classifications to find the different taxa
belonging to different taxonomic levels. Then we will calculate the contingency tables in order
to compare our two methods and the botanical reality.
